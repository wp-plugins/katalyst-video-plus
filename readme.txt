== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need an developer key for YouTube? =
YouTube's anonymous api has a limited amount of requests per day. In most cases, that limit is exhausted rather quickly. A developer key allows for 50,000,000 requests per day.

= Why do only a few users show up as authors? =
By default, authorship can only be attributed to users with the 'author' role or greater.
